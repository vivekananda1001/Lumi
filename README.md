4. Core Features and Azure AI Integration
1. Task Input and Analysis
●
Use Azure AI Language service to analyze task descriptions for key information,
sentiment, and urgency.
●
Implement natural language processing to extract deadlines, importance, and
task categories.
2. Image-Based Task Creation
●
Utilize Azure AI Computer Vision to allow users to upload images of handwritten
to-do lists or whiteboards.

Employ GPT-4 model to develop an intelligent prioritization algorithm that
considers various factors like deadlines, importance, estimated time, and user
preferences.
●
Use the model to generate personalized task recommendations and explanations
for prioritization decisions.
4. Multi-Language Support
●
Integrate Azure AI Translation service to enable users to input tasks in their
preferred language.
5. Document-Based Task Extraction
●
Use Azure AI Document Intelligence to parse through uploaded documents (e.g.,
meeting minutes, project briefs) and automatically extract potential tasks.
